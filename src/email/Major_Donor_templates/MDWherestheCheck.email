Dear {!Opportunity.OwnerFullName},

Two weeks ago you talked to {!Opportunity.Contact__c} of {!Opportunity.Account}, asking them to donate {!Opportunity.Amount}.  They agreed.  Congrats.

But we still haven't seen their check.  It's a good time to follow up and see when we can expect it, or if we need to pass by their offices to pick it up.  

Call them at their office at {!Account.Phone}.  Their home number is {!Contact.HomePhone}.  Their other phone number is {!Contact.OtherPhone}.

Thanks and good luck!
