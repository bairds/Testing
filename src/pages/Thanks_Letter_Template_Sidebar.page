Dear {!Opportunity.Account.Dear__c}: <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your generous gift of <apex:outputText value=" "/><apex:outputfield value="{!Opportunity.Amount}"  /> 
on <apex:outputText value=" {0,date,MMMM d, yyyy}"> <br/> <apex:param value="{!TODAY()}" /> </apex:outputText> 
to the WaterGrass River Alliance for our {!Opportunity.Campaign.Name} campaign.<br/>
<br/>  
Thanks to the support of members like you, we are able to continue our proud fourteen year history 
of protecting the health of the WaterGrass River.<br/>
<br/>
This July we unveiled our revised WaterGrass Water Agenda.  This comprehensive guide for protecting 
the WaterGrass River has been providing strategic direction for river advocates all across the state since 2007.  
The updated version focuses on goal-oriented solutions to achieving healthy waters in the state.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, we continue to provide leadership in networking and supporting an alliance of more than 
sixty local community groups working across the state to protect their local waterways.  
This alliance of concerned citizens, which recently came together for our 13th annual conference, 
Water Rally, is the backbone of our river movement and we are proud to play such an important role.<br/>
<br/>
You care and we are grateful that you have chosen to act on that concern by giving to the WaterGrass River Alliance.  
Together we can protect healthy rivers and healthy people!<br/>
<br/>
